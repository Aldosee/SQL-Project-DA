 ## üîé Analysis


### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

In this query, identify highest-paying data analyst job by filtering with the "WHERE" clause. Include remote positions and order them by salary to recognize the high paying salary. Then, return only the top 10 values using "LIMIT". 

```SELECT *
FROM job_postings_fact
LIMIT 10;

SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_via,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_work_from_home,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_work_from_home = 'TRUE' AND
    job_title_short LIKE 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
#### The result:
The top-paying data analyst jobs based on the provided dataset, include a Data Analyst position at Mantys with a average salary of $650,000 per year, followed by a Director of Analytics role at Meta with a average salary of $336,500 per year, and an Associate Director-Data Insights position at AT&T with a average salary of $255,829.5 per year.

### 2. Skills required for Top Paying jobs
To identify the skills needed for top paying job in the market. I joined job postings tables, company table, and skill job table. The query showed the companies high salary with corresponding skills needed.

```
WITH top_10_job AS (
    SELECT 
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_title,
        name AS company_names,
        job_schedule_type,
        job_work_from_home,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id 
    WHERE
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_work_from_home = 'TRUE' AND
        job_title_short LIKE 'Data Analyst'
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

    SELECT  
        top_10_job.*,
        skills
    FROM 
        top_10_job
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_job_dim ON top_10_job.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC;
 ```
 #### The result:
The table summarizes data analyst job positions from multiple companies offering full-time schedules with remote work and salaries ranging from $184,000 to $255,829.5 annually and the common  skills required such as SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Excel. AT&T the topped highest salary varying different skills for Data Analyst.

### 3. In demand skills for Data Analyst
To identify the skills in demand for the role as a Data Analyst. I joined the table job posting, skill job, and skill to arrive the top 5 skills in demand.
```
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_skill_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN  
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = 'True'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_skill_count DESC
LIMIT 
    5;
```

 #### The result:
The vizualisation showed the demand skills for Data Analyst with SQL being the most in-demand skill, followed by Excel, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. These findings indicate a strong reliance on database querying and management skills (SQL), data analysis and visualization capabilities (Excel, Python, Tableau), and business intelligence tools (Power BI) in various industries.

```
SELECT 
        skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM 
        job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN  
        skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN 
        skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
